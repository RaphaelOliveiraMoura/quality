# Welcome to nata.house's quality wiki

This document describes specific programming practices that help ensure your final product will be easy and pleasant to use, both for end-users and other developers as well. The idea is to showcase some of these in order to remind our devs that every piece of software developed by nata.house must follow these practices, in order to make sure we are delivering the best possible product.

Please note that we won’t focus on specific coding practices here, the idea is to describe product requirements that should always be implemented when we are delivering, regardless of whether it was on the client’s requirement list or not.

Let's create better software together!
