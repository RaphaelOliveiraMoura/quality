# Web Development

**Of course, always use loading indicators to tell your user that the content is being loaded. Use loading content placeholders when loading pages, like so: **

**Use css and not JS to display or hide information in your page! This is important for both performance and SEO, it is faster to use css and also the search engine robot must be able to assess all the content in your page, not only the part that is currently visible to the user.**

*@CONTRIBUTE Add an example of this practice)*

**Use local storage to persist user data. For the vast majority of the web apps we build, we donâ€™t want our user to have to enter his credentials every time he wants to use the platform, so we solve this by storing his information in the browser local storage. Unless there is a specific requirement from the client that prevents us from using this approach, this should always be done!**

* Also applies to mobile apps!
